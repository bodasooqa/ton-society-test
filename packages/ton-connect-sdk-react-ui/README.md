# @workspace/ton-connect-sdk-react-ui

aka [@tonconnect/ui-react](https://github.com/ton-connect/sdk/tree/main/packages/ui-react)

This package provides a set of React components for building user interfaces for TON Connect SDK.
It should be here because the original npm package is not available to be used in the project with React 19.

See the [issue](https://github.com/ton-connect/sdk/issues/216) for more information.
